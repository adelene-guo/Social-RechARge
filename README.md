Social RechARge's Culture LeARning's primary goal is to teach you about the world and about the numerous beautiful cultures in the world. Through our augmented reality features, you will find how to appreciate and enjoy the beauty of diversity and celebrate the joys they translate.

You can spread the joy and share the culture too with sheer love of diversity by using our Send a cARd feature. You can send 3D AR e-cards that will celebrate days that your friends or family might never heard of or are curious about. You will spread smiles, teach those, and awknowledge peoples' differences.
